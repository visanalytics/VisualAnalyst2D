# VisualAnalyst2D
This project aimed to implement a simple 2D data terrain, where 2D visualisations are based around Google Maps.
A built-in dataset comes from the VicRoads “CrashStats” data about motor vehicle accidents, which has been drawn 
from data.vic.gov.au, see:

http://www.data.vic.gov.au/data/dataset/crash-stats-data-extract 

Download the entire data folder into a directory on your web server and open the index.html file.
Note that if you make too many Google Maps queries in a day, Google may decide to cut you off.
In such high volume of Google transactions is required you need to open a Google developer account.
